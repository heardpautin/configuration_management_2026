CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PROJECT 2026. 

# Configuration Management & Baseline Enforcement
## Security-Focused Configuration Governance (IAM • GRC • Cloud • Healthcare • Federal)

---

## Project Purpose

This project demonstrates **Configuration Management as a security, governance, and risk control**, not traditional system administration.

The goal is to show how configuration discipline:
- Preserves **approved security baselines**
- Prevents **configuration drift**
- Supports **audit readiness**
- Enforces **least privilege and change accountability**

This mirrors real-world Configuration Management responsibilities in:
- Healthcare IT environments
- Federal / DoD programs
- Financial institutions
- Cloud-first regulated enterprises

---

## Why Configuration Management Is a Security Function

Configuration changes directly impact:
- Identity permissions
- Access pathways
- System hardening
- Audit outcomes
- Regulatory compliance

Poor configuration control leads to:
- Privilege creep
- Unauthorized access
- Failed audits
- Security incidents

Configuration Management ensures systems remain in a **known, sanctioned, defensible state** aligned with policy and frameworks.

## Configuration Management Scope

This project covers:

- Configuration baselines
- Change documentation
- Evidence collection
- Identity-related configuration
- Cloud and on-prem concepts
- Audit-ready artifacts

---

## Section 1: Configuration Baseline Definition

### Objective
Define what a **secure, approved configuration** looks like before changes occur.

### Example Baseline Areas
- Identity group membership
- Role assignments
- Conditional Access policies
- Service configuration
- Security hardening settings

### Example Baseline Artifact
- RBAC Matrix
- Group-to-role mappings
- Approved access patterns
- Change approval requirements

#### Evidence Placeholder
📸 **Screenshot Placeholder:**  
- Baseline documentation (RBAC matrix, role definitions, policy export)

**[Insert Screenshot Here: Approved Baseline Documentation]**

---

### What This Shows

- You understand that security starts with **defined baselines**
- You can translate policy into **technical configuration standards**
- You treat configuration as a **governed artifact**, not tribal knowledge

---

## Section 2: Change Control & Documentation

### Objective
Ensure **every configuration change** is authorized, documented, and traceable.

### Change Control Elements
- Change request identification
- Business justification
- Risk assessment
- Approval record
- Implementation evidence

### Example Change Record Fields
- Change ID
- Configuration Item (CI)
- Before state
- After state
- Approver
- Implementation date

#### Evidence Placeholder
📸 **Screenshot Placeholder:**  
- Change log (Excel / ticket / markdown)
- Before & after configuration comparison

**[Insert Screenshot Here: Change Request & Approval Record]**

---

### What This Shows

- You understand **audit trails**
- You can defend configuration changes during audits
- You prevent unauthorized or undocumented changes

---

## Section 3: Configuration Drift Detection

### Objective
Identify when systems **deviate from approved baselines**.

### Drift Examples
- Extra group memberships
- Unauthorized permissions
- Changed security settings
- Out-of-policy configurations

### Detection Methods
- Manual reviews
- Periodic access reviews
- Configuration comparisons
- Script-based checks

#### Evidence Placeholder
📸 **Screenshot Placeholder:**  
- Drift detection output
- Comparison showing mismatch

**[Insert Screenshot Here: Configuration Drift Identified]**

---

### What This Shows

- You understand **continuous monitoring**
- You can identify security risk caused by drift
- You treat drift as a **security issue**, not an inconvenience

---

## Section 4: Remediation & Baseline Restoration

### Objective
Return systems to a **secure, approved state** after drift is identified.

### Remediation Actions
- Remove unauthorized access
- Restore approved configuration
- Document corrective action
- Validate post-remediation state

#### Evidence Placeholder
📸 **Screenshot Placeholder:**  
- Post-remediation configuration
- Validation output

**[Insert Screenshot Here: Baseline Restored]**

---

### What This Shows

- You close the loop on configuration issues
- You understand **corrective action**
- You support audit closure and risk reduction

---

## Section 5: Identity-Centric Configuration Management

### Objective
Demonstrate how **IAM is a configuration management problem**.

### Identity Configurations Managed
- Group membership
- Role assignments
- Privileged access
- Distribution lists
- Access lifecycle (JML)

### Examples
- Removing users from old roles during a move
- Enforcing least privilege
- Preventing toxic combinations (SoD)

#### Evidence Placeholder
📸 **Screenshot Placeholder:**  
- Group membership before/after
- Role assignment review

---

### What This Shows

- You understand IAM beyond provisioning
- You connect identity governance to configuration discipline
- You reduce insider risk and privilege creep

---

## Section 6: Healthcare & Enterprise Operations Context

### Why This Matters in Healthcare IT

Healthcare environments require:
- Strict access control
- Auditable change history
- Minimal disruption
- Regulatory defensibility (HIPAA, HITECH)

Configuration Management ensures:
- Systems remain compliant
- Access changes are justified
- Admin activity is controlled

This directly supports:
- Tier 2 / Tier 2.5 security operations
- IAM oversight roles
- Compliance and audit functions

---

### What This Shows

- You understand **real-world enterprise IT**
- You recognize healthcare-specific risk
- You can operate in regulated environments

---

## Section 7: Evidence & Audit Readiness

### Evidence Types Collected
- Baseline documentation
- Change approvals
- Drift detection output
- Remediation validation
- Access review artifacts

### Audit Use
- Internal audits
- External audits
- Compliance reviews
- Management reporting

#### Evidence Placeholder
📸 **Screenshot Placeholder:**  
- Folder structure with evidence
- Audit-ready artifacts

**[Insert Screenshot Here: Audit Evidence Package]**

---

### What This Shows

- You think like an auditor
- You prepare evidence proactively
- You reduce audit friction and findings

---

## Final Summary

This project demonstrates that:

- Configuration Management is a **core security control**
- Identity, cloud, and governance are interconnected
- Secure systems depend on **maintained baselines**
- Audit readiness is built continuously, not retroactively

This is not system administration —  
This is **security governance through configuration discipline**.

---

## Next Enhancements (Optional)

- Automated drift detection
- CI/CD policy enforcement
- IaC baseline validation
- Continuous compliance reporting
